# Generating TV Script with RNN in PyTorch

## Overview
Writing scripts for a TV program is a mundane task. Imagine writing every words which come out from every characters in a movie to get a complete script. Intead of writing manually, why not leaving this mundane to computer? That is what going to be covered in this project. In this case, I used Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) implemented in PyTorch.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository into your machine by typing the following command on your Linux terminal or Windows command prompt.
```
> git clone https://github.com/jhonsonlee/tv-script-generation-in-pytorch.git
```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook in your machine by typing the following command.
```
> jupyter notebook
```
3. On your Jupyter Notebook console head to the directory where your clone the repository and then open `dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb`.

Happy coding! Happy learning!
