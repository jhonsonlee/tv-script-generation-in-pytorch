## Generating TV Script with RNN in PyTorch
One of many Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) applications is to generate TV script. In this case, it can be seen that RNN memorizes all the words in the script, the sequence of words and the story as well. Therefore, memory is an essential component in RNN. This repo covers good introduction of RNN implementation in PyTorch with real implementation of script generation.
